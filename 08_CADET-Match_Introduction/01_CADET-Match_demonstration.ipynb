    "### Featues and scores\n",
    "\n",
    "Scores are how the search algorithm measures if a solution is better or worse than what it had before. \n",
    "Without a good score system an optimizer can't work. \n",
    "There are many scores available and here we will discuss the most commonly used ones. \n",
    "A complete overview can be found [here](https://github.com/modsim/CADET-Match/tree/master/CADETMatch/scores).\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of these scores are based on physical understanding of the problem and it is pretty easy to add new scores.\n",
    "If there is a feature you can identify in your problem that ties to one of the variables being estimated then go ahead and make a score for it.\n",
    "Maybe for your isotherm the width of the peak or some other feature reveals important information.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Shape**\\\n",
    "  This is the default score used when fitting an isotherm. \n",
    "  It looks at the shape, position, and height of the peak. \n",
    "  It has a small initial penalty for the peak being out of position in time and increases as the peak gets further away. \n",
    "  This is to deal with the problem of pump delays and other experimental errors. \n",
    "  The best fit may not be and often is not the peak that is in exactly the right location but it is the one with the right shape. \n",
    "  The shape is determined by the physics which is why it is so heavily emphasied in the score system.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **ShapeDecay**\\\n",
    "  This is the default score to use when fitting transport parameters. \n",
    "  Transport experiments are more difficult because you MUST make sure that as few errors as possible happened in the physical experiment. \n",
    "  On most AKTA type systems if there is an alarm the timer for data collection is also paused until the alarm is cleared and the system resumes. \n",
    "  his results in data that has no gap in the time. \n",
    "  However, the chemicals are still reacting and moving even if the pumps are off and data collection stops. \n",
    "  Any such error that occurs will result in the diffusion being wrong and the longer the error persists before being fixed the more wrong the estimate for diffusion will be. \n",
    "  Things like pump delays or other pauses in the system can cause problems with estimating volume or porosity. \n",
    "  Any errors that occur in transport experiments will be carried through to isotherm parameters which harms scaleup later.\n",
    "  \n",
    "1. **ShapeFront**\\\n",
    "  This score looks at only the front of the peak. \n",
    "  It is designed to use with a breakthrough that just levels off and does not go back down.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **ShapeBack**\\\n",
    "  This score looks at only the back of the peak. It is designed for situations that start at a high concentration and drops over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **DextranShape**\\\n",
    "  Dextran is a nice tracer overall but it has non ideal behavior in most systems. \n",
    "  You normally see this in strange tailing behavior. \n",
    "  What this means is that only the front side of the peak can be used. \n",
    "  This score specifically looks only at the front side of the peak.\n",
    "  \n",
    "1. **DextranSSE**\\\n",
    "  This works like DextranShape and cuts out just the front part of the peak but uses SSE for the score. **This score can not be combined with any of the other scores since it does not range from 0 to 1.**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **fractionationSlide**\\\n",
    "  If you have a fractionation proble use this score. Internally it is a little complex. After each simulation for each species it numerically slides the chromatogram back and forward in time and refactionates at each time to find which location best matches the experimental data to find the time difference between the synthetic and experimental peak along with a shape comparison at that time.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **SSE**\\\n",
    "  This is the Sum of Squared Errors. **This score can not be combined with any of the other scores since it does not range from 0 to 1.**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **AbsoluteHeight** and **AbsoluteTime**\\\n",
    "  These scores are needed by the MCMC system. They are absolute measurements of height and time since the beginning of the simulation. They are used to capture the impact of errors that have an assymetric impact on the peaks."

    "### Search MethodMethodMethod\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 5 main search methods and only 3 of them are normally used.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **NSGA3**\\\n",
    "  This is the default evolutionary algorithm and the best choice to use when you don't know anything about your search space.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Multistart**\\\n",
    "  This is a multistart gradient descent algorithm. If your problem can be solved with gradient descent then this can be a very good choice. It creates an initial population the same way that NSGA3 does so that you don't have to worry about starting point. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **GraphSpace**\\\n",
    "  This is not for optimization and instead it is just for sampling the space. If you have a new problem and you have no idea what the range of any of the parameters are you can use this with a very large population and it will just evaluate the entire starting population and then terminate. This allows you to figure out what are plausiable ranges for your variables before using one of the search algorithms. When dealing with many variables it is still possible to miss regions of viable solutions inside large non-viable regions but in practice this has rarely been a problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **MCMC**\\\n",
    "  This performans the error modeling and sampling. It is not an optimization algorithm and while it will probably find the optimum value while it runs it is very slow to do so and won't stop even if it finds the optimal value. This should also not be used directly. Normally NSGA3 is used and an option is set to continue with MCMC after NSGA3 has completed. This allows MCMC to be seeded with the best values from NSGA3 which dramatically improves convergence. If you have many variables and you run this directly it may never converge since it may never find high probability regions, much less sample from them effectively. \n",
    " \n",
    "1. **Gradient**\\\n",
    "  This is a single start gradient descent algorithm. In order to work you need to give a good enough starting point. Generally it is advisable to use Multistart instead."
